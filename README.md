# How To Create Font Assets
You need to create font assets from font files to use them with TextMeshPro. Here are basic instructions for convenience. You can check out the [official TextMeshPro documentation](https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.textmeshpro@4.0/manual/FontAssetsCreator.html) to learn more.
  
Open `Window/TextMeshPro/Font Asset Creator` window.

![FontAssetCreatorWindow](Screenshots/FontAssetCreator.PNG)

1. Assign your font in `Font Source` field (Your font must include your characters)
2. Set atlas size. For Arabic we recomment 512x512 and for Hebrew 128x128 as a minimum. A larger atlas will have better quality but larger size on disk.
3. Set `Character Set` to `Unicode Range`.
4. Copy character ranges from files under `Assets/RTLTMPro/Ranges` folder into `Character Sequence (Hex)`.
   * Arabic letters are in `ArabicLetters.txt` file
   * Arabic digits are in `ArabicDigits.txt` file
   * Arabic tashkeel letter are in `ArabicTashkeel.txt` file.
   * All arabic characters are in `ArabicAll.txt`. Normally you would use this to create your font asset.
   * Hebrew letters are in `HebrewLetters.txt`.
6. Press `Generate Font Atlas` button and wait for it to generate the atlas.
7. Press `Save TextMeshPro Font Asset` and save the font asset.
  
## Usage Description

* Use `GameObject/UI/* - RTLTMP` menu to create RTL UI elements. (Alternatively you can replace `Text Mesh Pro UGUI` components with `RTL Text Mesh Pro`)
* Assign your font asset `Font Asset` property in `RTL Text Mesh Pro` component 
* Enter text in `RTL TEXT INPUT BOX` secion.

### Farsi
When checked, English numbers will be converted to Farsi numbers.
When unchecked, English numbers will be converted to Arabic numbers.  

### Preserve Numbers
When checked numbers will not be converted.  

### Force Fix
RTL Text Mesh Pro does not fix texts that start with English characters. 
Checking this checkbox forces RTL TextMeshPro to fix the text even when it starts with English character. 
**Multiline English texts will have problem on components that have `ForceFix` checked.**  

### Fix Tags
When checked, RTL Text Mesh Pro will try to fix rich text tags.  

# Known Issues
* **Fixed in latest version. For older versions follow the steps below**.
  We need to override the `text` property of `TextMeshProUGUI`. But the `text` property is not defined `virtual`. You need to manually make the property virtual.  
  * Open `TMP_Text.cs` from TextMeshPro source code
  * add virtual keyword to text property.  
  ![Text](Screenshots/TextProperty.PNG)
  * Open `RTLTextMeshPro.cs` and uncomment the top line where it says `//#define RTL_OVERRIDE`
  * Now you can use InputFields and Dropdowns.
