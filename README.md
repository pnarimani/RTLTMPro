### from OpenUPM
[hk1ll3r](https://github.com/hk1ll3r/) maintains a package manager version of this repo on [OpenUPM](https://openupm.com/packages/com.nosuchstudio.rtltmpro/).

In Project Settings window, add OpenUPM as a scoped registry or if you have already added it, add the new scope to it.

The sample scenes and demo resources (fonts, shaders, etc.) are included in the package as a .unitypackage file. You need to import those into your Assets folder to use them. From the project window navigate to the package folder and double click "RTLTMPRo-demo-resources" file to import these assets into your project.

# How To Use
* Open one of the range files in `Assets/RTLTMPro/Ranges/` folder using your favorite text editor.
  * RTL Letters are in `LetterRanges.txt` file
  * English, Arabic and Farsi numbers are in `NumberRanges.txt` file
  * Arabic tashil are in `TashkilRanges.txt` file.
* Make sure you have copied ranges that you want to use
* Open `Window/TextMeshPro/Font Asset Creator` window.
* Assign your font in `Font Source` field (Your font must support RTL characters)
* Set `Character Set` to `Unicode Range`
* Paste copied ranges inside  `Character Sequence (Hex)`
* Press `Generate Font Atlas` button and wait for it to generate the atlas file.
* Press `Save TextMeshPro Font Asset` and save the asset.
* Use `GameObject/UI/* - RTLTMP` menu to create RTL UI elements. (Alternatively you can replace `Text Mesh Pro UGUI` components with `RTL Text Mesh Pro`)
* Assign your font asset `Font Asset` property in `RTL Text Mesh Pro` component 
* Enter text in `RTL TEXT INPUT BOX` secion.
  
## Usage Description
### Farsi
When checked, English numbers will be converted to Farsi numbers.
When unchecked, English numbers will be converted to Arabic numbers.  

### Preserve Numbers
When checked numbers will not be converted.  

### Force Fix
RTL Text Mesh Pro does not fix texts that start with English characters. 
Checking this checkbox forces RTL TextMeshPro to fix the text even when it starts with English character. 
**Multiline English texts will have problem on components that have `ForceFix` checked.**  

### Fix Tags
When checked, RTL Text Mesh Pro will try to fix rich text tags.  

# Known Issues
* **Fixed in latest version. For older versions follow the steps below**
  We need to override the `text` property of `TextMeshProUGUI`. But the `text` property is not defined `virtual`. You need to manually make the property virtual.  
  * Open `TMP_Text.cs` from TextMeshPro source code
  * add virtual keyword to text property.  
  ![Text](Screenshots/TextProperty.PNG)
  * Open `RTLTextMeshPro.cs` and uncomment the top line where it says `//#define RTL_OVERRIDE`
  * Now you can use InputFields and Dropdowns.
